A hardhat stack that develop, test and deploy a smart contract to let supporter buy me a coffee

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

For deployment, first add a network configuration at `hardhat.config.js`, then run
```shell
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
```
